# Emmytex Laundry Service - Booking Website

This is a responsive 4-page front-end booking website built for **Emmytex Laundry and Cleaning Service**, a modern laundry business based in Nigeria. This project is a part of my front-end portfolio to showcase my design and development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The Emmytex Laundry Service Booking Website is designed to make it easy for users to learn about the laundry services offered, book appointments online, and find contact information — all through a clean, user-friendly interface.
